            <h2>Autobiographical Game</h2>
            <p>I was tasked to create my own game in p5js that is autobiographical. This means the game should be about anything from my life that specifically pertains to me. I had to use a series of functions, switches, and classes to create this game.</p>

            <h2>Optical Illusion</h2>
            <p>I was tasked to create an optical illusion using loops. For this illusion, I used a couple of loops to allow for multiple shapes to be created as they move in different speeds. I thought this was interesting to capture a sort of "illusion" where both animations are overlapping each other.</p>

            <h2>Interactive Typography</h2>
            <p>I was tasked to use the textToPoints function in p5.js in order to experiment with text effects, and create individual posters using words that intrigue me. I decided to pick the words Happy, Flow, and Magic as they allow me to visualize a lot when thinking about them. I used what I learned from the previous semester, as well as the new concept of textToPoints in order to convey the visuals of these words and create a more elaborate representation. Here is a demonstration of one of the examples I created.</p>
